I work in Red Team / Penetration Testing with a strong focus on **manual exploitation** and understanding systems at a technical level.

I’m not interested in running tools blindly or following step-by-step checklists.  
My approach is to understand **how and why systems fail**, then reproduce and validate those failures in a controlled way.

Most of the material here comes from real hands-on work: labs, failed attempts, repeated testing, and personal notes taken during exploitation — not copied summaries or autogenerated content.

---

## Areas of Focus
- Web application penetration testing  
- Linux and Windows system exploitation  
- Privilege escalation and post-exploitation  
- Enumeration, attack surface mapping, and attack path building  
- Analysis of security misconfigurations and weak assumptions  

---

## Technical Stack

### Programming & Scripting
- **Python**  
  Used for automation, proof-of-concept scripts, and small custom tools written to better understand exploitation mechanics.

- **JavaScript**  
  Used mainly for client-side behavior analysis, DOM-based issues, and understanding browser-side attack vectors.

### Operating Systems & Environments
- **Linux** – primary attacking environment  
- **Windows** – target analysis, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation  
- **Virtual Machines** – isolated lab environments for repeatable testing  

---

## Practice & Learning Platforms
- **Hack The Box** – machines, labs, and CTF-style challenges  
- **TryHackMe** – structured paths combined with hands-on practice  
- **PortSwigger Web Security Academy** – in-depth research of web vulnerabilities  

These platforms are used mainly for **practical testing and experimentation**, not for point collection or superficial completion.

## What You’ll Find in This Repository
- Write-ups of labs and machines I’ve actually solved, focusing on *attack logic* rather than just commands  
- Personal notes that break down vulnerabilities, exploitation flow, and common patterns  
- Small custom tools and scripts written while learning how systems behave internally  

The goal is clarity and understanding — not volume.

---

## Methodology & Approach
- Manual enumeration before automation  
- Validate assumptions instead of trusting tools  
- Break complex problems into small, testable steps  
- Automate only after the process is fully understood
