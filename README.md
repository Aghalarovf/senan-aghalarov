I work in Red Team / Penetration Testing.

I’m not interested in running tools blindly.  
My focus is understanding **how and why things break**, then reproducing it manually.

Most of what’s here comes from hands-on testing, failed attempts, retries, and notes taken during labs — not copied course summaries.

## Focus Areas
- Web application penetration testing  
- Linux & Windows system exploitation  
- Privilege escalation and misconfigurations  
- Enumeration and attack path building  

---

## Technical Stack
- Python – small automation scripts, custom security tools  
- JavaScript – client-side behavior and web exploitation logic  
- Linux – primary attacking environment  
- Windows – target analysis and escalation  
- Virtual Machines – isolated lab environments  

---

## Practice Platforms
- Hack The Box  
- TryHackMe  
- PortSwigger Web Security Academy  

Used mainly for **hands-on testing**, not point collecting.

## This Repository Contains
- Write-ups of labs and machines I’ve actually solved  
- Personal notes focused on attack logic, not definitions  
- Small custom tools written while learning how things work internally  

---

## Approach
Manual first.  
Automation only after understanding the process.
